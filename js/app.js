## 1. Verbal questions

    Write answers to the following questions as comments. 

1.  What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
2.  Within a function, what is the difference between **return** and 
    **console.log**?
3.  What are the implications of the ability of a function to return a value?
*/

// 1. 
// Parameters are the placeholder names declared in the fuction.
// Arguments are the actual values passed to and recieved by the function.

// 2. 
//  **return** ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to
//  the function caller.  The **console** object provides access to the browser's
//  debugging console. **.log()** is a method of the console object that outputs 
//  a message to the console.  **return** does not display values to the
//  console, rather it 'returns' it to whatever called it. The output value of 
//  a function can not come from a console.log.

// 3. 
//  Functions that have the ability to return values allows programmers
//  to create large programs by 'dividing and conquering'. Functions reduce 
//  repetition by outsourcing repetitive operations.  It also fosters
//  collaboration by allowing for modularization.
